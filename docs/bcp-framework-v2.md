# Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Framework
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-05-27

---

## Overview

A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) ensures an organization can continue critical operations during and after a disruption. The **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan** is a focused subset of the BCP, specifically covering IT and technology recovery.

> **Key Relationship:** BCP covers the entire organization. DR Plan sits inside BCP and focuses specifically on IT/technology recovery.

## BCP Components

### 1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Identifies critical business functions and processes
- Assesses the impact of disruptions (financial, operational, reputational)
- Defines **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**

**Data Points:**
- 60% of companies that lose their data shut down within 6 months *(Boston Computing Network)*
- Average cost of IT downtime: **$5,600/minute** *(Gartner)*

---

### 2. Risk Assessment
- Identifies potential threats (natural disasters, cyberattacks, power outages, etc.)
- Evaluates likelihood and severity of each risk

**Data Points:**
- 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error *(IBM Security Report)*
- Natural disasters caused **$313 billion** in economic losses in 2022 *(Swiss Re Institute)*

---

### 3. Recovery Strategies
- Plans for restoring critical functions within acceptable timeframes
- Covers people, facilities, suppliers, and operations

**Data Points:**
- Only **54% of organizations** have a company-wide BCP *(Mercer)*
- Businesses without a recovery strategy are **2.5x more likely** to go out of business after a disaster *(FEMA)*

---

### 4. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan & Strategy *(IT-focused subset of BCP)*
- DR strategy: Hot / Warm / Cold site, Cloud failover
- Data backup and restoration procedures
- Failover and failback procedures
- IT system recovery priorities (aligned to RTO/RPO from BIA)
- Alternate infrastructure and vendor dependencies

**Data Points:**
- **93% of companies** without DR who suffer a major data disaster are out of business within one year *(University of Texas)*
- **96% of businesses** with a trusted backup and DR plan survived ransomware attacks *(Acronis)*
- RTO/RPO misalignment costs enterprises avg. **$1.4M per incident** *(IDC)*

---

### 5. Roles and Responsibilities
- BCP team structure and DR team
- Clear ownership for each recovery task

---

### 6. Alternate Site / Work Arrangements
- Hot, warm, or cold standby sites
- Remote work capabilities

---

### 7. Communication Plan
- Internal communication (staff, management)
- External communication (customers, vendors, regulators, media)
- Contact lists and notification procedures

**Data Points:**
- Poor communication during a crisis increases recovery time by **up to 50%** *(Deloitte Crisis Management Survey)*

---

### 8. Incident Response Plan
- Immediate steps to take when a disruption occurs
- Escalation procedures and decision-making authority

**Data Points:**
- Organizations with an IR team save an average of **$2.66 million** per breach *(IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023)*
- Mean time to identify a breach: **207 days** without a plan *(IBM 2023)*

---

### 9. Testing and Exercises
- Regular drills: tabletop exercises, simulations, full DR tests
- Validates that the plan works as expected

**Data Points:**
- Only **23% of organizations** test their BCP annually *(Disaster Recovery Journal)*
- Companies that regularly test DR plans recover **2x faster** than those that don't *(IBM)*

---

### 10. Plan Maintenance
- Scheduled reviews and updates
- Version control and change management

---

## End-to-End Example: E-Commerce Company "ShopNow"

**Company profile:** Online retail platform, 500 employees, $50M annual revenue, AWS-hosted infrastructure.

### Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Description | Critical Level |
|---|---|---|
| A | Office Wi-Fi outage | 🟢 Low |
| B | Key supplier delays shipment | 🟡 Medium |
| C | Ransomware attack on production database | 🔴 High |

---

### Scenario A — Office Wi-Fi Outage 🟢 Low

**1. BIA**
- Affected function: Internal staff communication
- RTO: 4 hours | RPO: N/A (no data loss risk)
- Financial impact: Minimal — staff can use mobile hotspots

**2. Risk Assessment**
- Threat: ISP failure or router hardware fault
- Likelihood: High | Severity: Low

**3. Recovery Strategy**
- Staff switch to mobile hotspots or work from home
- IT contacts ISP for SLA-based resolution

**4. DR Plan**
- No IT failover needed
- Backup 4G routers pre-configured and stored on-site

**5. Roles & Responsibilities**
- IT Helpdesk: diagnose and escalate to ISP
- Team leads: notify staff of work-from-home option

**6. Alternate Site**
- Staff work remotely via VPN

**7. Communication Plan**
- IT sends Slack/email notification to all staff within 15 minutes

**8. Incident Response**
- IT detects outage → checks router → contacts ISP → activates backup router
- Resolved within 2 hours

**9. Testing**
- Annual drill: simulate ISP outage, verify backup router activation

**10. Maintenance**
- Review ISP SLA annually; update backup router firmware quarterly

---

### Scenario B — Key Supplier Delays Shipment 🟡 Medium

**1. BIA**
- Affected function: Order fulfillment, customer delivery
- RTO: 48 hours | RPO: N/A
- Financial impact: ~$200K revenue at risk per day of delay

**2. Risk Assessment**
- Threat: Supplier bankruptcy, port strike, natural disaster at supplier location
- Likelihood: Medium | Severity: Medium

**3. Recovery Strategy**
- Activate secondary pre-approved supplier
- Prioritize high-value orders from existing inventory
- Offer customers estimated delay notification + discount voucher

**4. DR Plan**
- No IT failover needed
- Update inventory and order management system to reflect new supplier lead times

**5. Roles & Responsibilities**
- Procurement Manager: contact secondary supplier within 4 hours
- Customer Service Lead: prepare customer communication templates
- Operations Manager: re-prioritize fulfillment queue

**6. Alternate Site**
- Secondary warehouse activated if primary fulfillment center is also affected

**7. Communication Plan**
- Internal: Operations team briefed within 2 hours
- External: Affected customers notified via email within 24 hours; public statement if delay exceeds 72 hours

**8. Incident Response**
- Procurement detects delay → escalates to Operations Manager → activates secondary supplier → updates ETA in system
- Customer service sends proactive notifications

**9. Testing**
- Semi-annual tabletop exercise: simulate supplier failure, test secondary supplier activation time
